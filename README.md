# When2Meet Data Export
This script is a fork from [finnlimjc](https://github.com/finnlimjc/When2Meet_Export), where the author graciously went through the annoyance of figuring out how to parse the when2meet html into usable data. Instead of exporting to excel as in their script, this script creates sets of people based on the time availability and then prints two maximally disjoint sets of people to decide on the most equitible times for office hours in classes that I teach. Feel free to use/copy/modify as needed.
